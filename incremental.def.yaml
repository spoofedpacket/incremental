# backup_exclude : "/usr/local/etc/incremental-exclude.list"

# Locations to back up. This is a hash of items
# and the full path that should be backed up. The
# name of the item can be arbitrary, but should be
# meaningful.
#
# Example:
#  backup_locations :
#   'very-important-directory' :
#     path : '/var/tmp/very-important-directory/'
#   'quite-important-directory' :
#     path : '/mnt/another-directory/'
#
#  incremental.py will create a directory in backup_root
#  named after each item, the incremental backups will be
#  stored there in the form BACKUP_ROOT/NAME_OF_ITEM/YYYYMMDD
#
backup_locations :
 'test' :
   path : '/var/tmp/incremental-test'
